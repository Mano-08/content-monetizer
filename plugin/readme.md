A plugin to help WordPress creators monetize their content by pushing it to decentralized storage and protecting access with protocol x402-powered paywalls.

== Description ==

**FILWPAgent** empowers WordPress users to monetize their posts and pages by storing their content on decentralized storage and allowing access only through a secure payment gateway powered by **Protocol x402**.

Visitors who wish to access protected content are redirected to a payment endpoint. Once payment is completed in USDC (or supported token), the content is retrieved securely from decentralized storage via a backend agent and shown to the user.

This provides a new way for creators and publishers to **protect, monetize, and share** content legally on the decentralized web.

### Key Features:

- Push WordPress content to decentralized storage.
- Protect access via protocol x402 (pay-to-access endpoints).
- Charge per-view using USDC or other accepted tokens.
- Compatible with both posts and custom pages.
- Easy setup via admin dashboard.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install directly via the WordPress plugin dashboard.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to `Settings > FILWPAgent` to configure your backend endpoint and x402 credentials.
4. Edit any post or page and enable the "Monetize" toggle to push the content and protect it.
