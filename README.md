# FILWPAgent: Fair AI Agent for WordPress Creators

**Turn your blog into an income stream by preventing illegal scraping and enabling AI-safe monetization.**

---

## Problem

Today, over 40% of the web is powered by WordPress. Yet, content creators face a growing threat of AI systems and bots scrape blogs illegally, using this content to train models or answer queries, without consent, compensation, or even attribution.

Content creators invest time and energy into producing valuable articles. But once published, they have little to no control over how that content is consumed or monetized. This has created a massive imbalance where platforms benefit, but the original authors do not.

## Solution

**FILWPAgent** is a lightweight WordPress plugin designed to help creators monetize their content.

With FILWPAgent, creators can:

-  Link their crypto wallet to receive payments  
-  Set a price in USDFC for accessing their content  
-  Monetize any blog post or page with a single click  
-  Only paying users or agents can access the content

The AI agent acts as a content gatekeeper, storing the blog data and responding only to paid requests.
